```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## Quick glimpse of chemical and entomological data from the dead juniper logs.

Here are the variables we have to work with:
```{r echo=FALSE}

names(meta)

```

There were a total of 17 tree samples taken.

## Here's a plot showing chemical compounds over time: 
```{r, out.width = "500px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../output/figs/Fig1_Chem_Area_over_Time.png")
```

## Here's the same plot, but not split by compound, showing average VOC over time
```{r, out.width = "500px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../output/figs/Fig2_Chem_Totals_over_Time.png")
```



## This shows percent yield (w/w) against time (years since area burned)
```{r, out.width = "500px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../output/figs/Fig3_Yield_over_Time.png")
```


## Here's the insect activity plotted against time since burn:
```{r, out.width = "500px",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../output/figs/Fig4_Insect_bore-holes_over_Time.png")
```


# None of these observations are significantly affected by time.

## Here's the stats table:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
readLines("../output/stats/glm_compounds_over_time.txt")
```
